# Decentralized Index Store

The purpose of this project is to create an application configured to access
a decentralized OrbitDB instance within IPFS PubSub, which will
retrieve stored indexes of IPFS objects.

This application itself is built statically and then uploaded onto IPFS,
where specific versions can be accessed through CID, or the latest version at the IPNS hash.
